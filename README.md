## About

Andromeda is a web platform that makes it possible:

* For authors to publish any kind of fictional or non-fictional work as an NFT.
* For readers to buy these NFTs and read the authors' works in different formats.

The mission of this platform is to allow authors to directly mint and tokenize their work, and to enable readers to access books simply.
The web platform is open source, and the writer pays only the gas fees required by the blockchain network to mint the text into an NFT. The reader pays the price set by the author.

If and when screen readers become available that can browse the web and log in to a platform using a blockchain wallet, users will be able to buy the book directly from the author and read it on their preferred device. In this way:

* Intermediary costs are reduced, benefiting both the author and the reader.
* The author can mint a limited quantity of copies, certified by the blockchain network, and set the price.
* The reader can buy a certified copy (the NFT) directly from the author, which is the digital equivalent of owning a signed copy.

The philosophy behind Andromeda is to directly connect authors with people who buy an NFT because they want to read the work, not just to speculate. The primary goal is to create a direct author-reader relationship, rather than a marketplace for financial investment in unread artworks (though this is also possible).
