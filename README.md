## About

Andromeda is a web platform with which is possible:

* for a writer to publish any kind of fiction work as NFT.
* for a reader to buy the NFT and read the fiction in different formats.

The mission of this platform is to allow writers to directly mint and tokenize their work.
The web platform is open source, and the writer will pay only the gas fees required by the blockchain network in order to mint the text into an NFT.

If and when will be available screen readers that browse the internet and can login to a platform using a blockchain wallet, the reader will be able to buy directly the book from the writer and read the fiction on her/his reading device. In this way:

* intermediary costs are reduced, with benefits for both the writer and the reader;
* The writer can mint a certain quantity of copies, certified by the blockchain network;
* The reader can buy a certified copy from the writer, and this is equivalent to having a copy autographed by the writer;
