## VDS component implementation

```
implement the <componentName> component and all the files in the folder, following the same criteria used for other components of the vds, then add the <componentName> in a dedicated box in the showcase page, <section> section. The <componentName> component follows the guidelines of the vds and implements the pattern already used of other vds components. Implement unit tests and the readme file, use the component index.ts file to export the component and export also in the index.ts file in the components folder
